### Rotating Graduate Researcher, Emory University
*September 2024 – November 2024*
Principal Investigator: Dr. Trisha Kesar
-	Developed an automated, low-maintenance, and time efficient means of inventorying R01 project’s extensive electrophysiology data using a user-friendly, interactive Python dashboard
-	Collected electromyography (EMG) data from stroke survivors undergoing fast treadmill walking or fast treadmill walking with functional electrical stimulation (FastFES) gait rehabilitative treatments
-	Modified data analysis workflow to automate EMG data processing using NeuroKit2 Python library, promoting rapid, high-throughput analyses of large EMG datasets while reducing errors and biases from manual data handling
-	Ongoing: Optimizing parameters to better clean FastFES EMG dataset and eliminate transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) artifacts

#### Graduate Researcher, Emory University
*June 2022 – August 2023*
Principal Investigator: Dr. Gary Bassell
-	Cultured human induced pluripotent stem cells, human neurons, and cerebral organoids
-	Transfected mouse primary culture neurons with DNA plasmids
-	Performed immunofluorescence staining and imaging on mouse primary culture neurons and human neural progenitor cells 
-	Detected protein-protein interactions using proximity ligation assays and co- 
immunoprecipitation assays
-	Quantified protein and DNA concentrations using Western blots and quantitative polymerase chain reactions, respectively

#### Professional Research Assistant, Knoebel Institute for Healthy Aging	
*June 2019 – June 2021*
Principal Investigator: Dr. Aurélie Ledreux
-	Developed Western blotting methods for detecting exosomal proteins in neuron-derived exosomes
-	Developed protocols to image exosomes via direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy on ONI super-resolution Nanoimager
-	Analyzed and visualized biomarker data in RStudio and GraphPad
-	Isolated neuron-derived exosomes from human blood samples
-	Quantified Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury biomarkers via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and single molecule arrays
-	Performed IF on mice brains, imaged stains via confocal microscopy, and measured florescence with densitometry

#### Undergraduate Researcher, Tarleton State University	
*June 2016 – May 2019*
Principal Investigator: Dr. Dustin Edwards
•	Developed polymerase chain reaction protocols to amplify retroviral DNA from dried blood spots
•	Detected viral proteins in blood samples via ELISAs

#### HHMI EXROP Fellow, University of California, San Diego	
*May 2018 – August 2018*
Principal Investigator: Dr. Joseph Gleeson
•	Amplified suspected gene mutations from human blood samples 
•	Analyzed sequenced DNA to identify potentially etiological mutations
